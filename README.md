# IBM Data Analyst Capstone Project

## Overview
This repository contains my **IBM Data Analyst Capstone Project**, a comprehensive data analysis case study that demonstrates my ability to apply key data analytics concepts and tools learned throughout the IBM Data Analyst Professional Certificate program. This project highlights my skills in data cleaning, exploratory data analysis (EDA), visualization, and deriving actionable insights to support data-driven decision making.

## Project Description
The IBM Data Analyst Capstone Project simulates a real-world business scenario where I was tasked with analyzing a dataset to identify trends, patterns, and key insights that can influence strategic decisions. Throughout the project, I applied various data analytics techniques and tools, including Python (Pandas, NumPy), Jupyter Notebooks, and visualization libraries such as Matplotlib and Seaborn.

The project workflow involved:

- **Data Cleaning & Preparation:** Handling missing data, correcting data types, and transforming variables for analysis.
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** Summarizing data distributions, identifying correlations, and visualizing key features.
- **Data Visualization:** Creating charts and graphs to clearly communicate findings.
- **Insight Generation:** Providing data-driven recommendations based on analysis.
- **Presentation:** Documenting the entire analysis process in a clear, reproducible manner.

## Skills Demonstrated
- Data wrangling with Python (Pandas, NumPy)
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Data visualization with Matplotlib and Seaborn
- Problem-solving with real-world business data
- Communicating insights effectively through reports and charts
- Working with Jupyter Notebooks for data storytelling

## Tools & Technologies
- Python (Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn)
- Jupyter Notebook
- IBM Watson Studio

## Project Outcome
The analysis revealed significant patterns and insights relevant to the business problem presented in the dataset, with actionable recommendations for stakeholders. This project showcases my readiness to tackle complex data analysis challenges and deliver value through data-driven solutions.
